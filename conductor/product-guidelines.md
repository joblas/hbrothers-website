# Product Guidelines: H Brothers Redesign

## 1. Tone of Voice
*   **Enthusiastic & Food-Focused:** The copy should be "crave-worthy," emphasizing the quality and tradition of the food (e.g., "12-hour smoked," "authentic poutine").
*   **Friendly & Local:** A welcoming, neighborly tone that mirrors the Escondido community vibe seen on their Instagram and Yelp.
*   **Professional & Precise:** The technical implementation (speed, AI responses) should feel high-end and effortless, reflecting Joe's Tech Solutions' standards.

## 2. Design Direction: "Rustic Tech" (Hybrid)
*   **Modern Precision:** High-contrast whitespace, bold modern typography, and clinical precision in layout to demonstrate technical excellence.
*   **Homestyle Warmth:** A color palette of deep forest greens and golden beiges, using high-quality lifestyle photography that captures the steam, texture, and atmosphere of the restaurant.
*   **Visual Balance:** Clean, "high-tech" UI elements (buttons, AI chat interface) over-laid on warm, rustic backgrounds or paired with rich food imagery.

## 3. Messaging Priorities
*   **Conversion First:** "Order Online" and "Get Directions" are the primary calls to action, always accessible and highly visible.
*   **Signature Dish Spotlight:** Vivid descriptions and high-res imagery for the Brisket Mac & Cheese and Poutine.
*   **Social Proof:** Prominent placement of Yelp/Google ratings and "Local Legend" accolades to build instant trust.

## 4. ADA & Technical Standards
*   **WCAG AA Compliance:** High color contrast for all text, especially when overlaid on images.
*   **Full Accessibility:** descriptive alt-text for food images, ARIA labels for the Gemini Concierge, and complete keyboard navigability.
*   **Mobile-First Performance:** Optimized for 5G/LTE speeds with lazy-loading and efficient asset delivery.

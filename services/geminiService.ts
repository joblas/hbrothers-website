## THE OWNERS & STORY
H Brothers is owned by brothers **Nick and Justin Hedayati**. The "H" stands for Hedayati - they chose "H Brothers" because their last name can be hard to remember!

The Hedayati brothers come from a restaurant family legacy. Their father owns Chicken Plus on Escondido Boulevard, a beloved local spot for Mediterranean cuisine where you can see chickens roasting on open flames from the street. Nick started helping at age 6, buttering pans, and both brothers worked there through their teens.

They opened H Brothers to bring something new to Grand Avenue - North American comfort food made from scratch. They spent two years renovating a former sushi restaurant and navigating city regulations before opening. As Nick says, "We wanted to do things that they weren't already doing on Grand Avenue."

## HERITAGE & CUISINE
The brothers blend their unique heritage into the menu:
- Their father is from Cyprus (Mediterranean influence - like the Tzatziki chicken wrap)
- Their mother is from Boston (New England influence - like clam chowder)
- French-Canadian heritage (explains the authentic poutine!)

Nick describes their food as "comfort food you didn't know you wanted." Their philosophy: "We're trying to give you your money's worth" with fair pricing, generous portions, and everything made fresh.
